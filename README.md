# Tempo

Tempo is a small language that loosely follows the book *Crafting Interpreters*
by Robert Nystrom. I just wanted to create a language from start to finish,
which is something I've never done before. I've started to work on many
languages, but I've never actually finished one. Keep in mind that this
language is a work-in-progress and the syntax and grammar will be subject to
frequent alteration Keep in mind that this language is a work-in-progress and
the syntax and grammar will be subject to frequent alteration.

If you are curious about the grammar of the language, refer to `grammar.txt`.
The implementation of the language closely parallels the grammar outlined in
that file.
